# iLect

An AAC app which's a new way to help fulfilling the most basic needs (e.g., eating, commuting) of anyone with communication disabilities.
It's quick and easy to use just only let them choose what they need and our app will bring to the most related third-party apps in each category. This app also demonstrates the incredible capability of Flutter, Google-created application framework, which's decreased the app development time immensely.

Total time we'd used to create this app until now are just only 31 working hours.
